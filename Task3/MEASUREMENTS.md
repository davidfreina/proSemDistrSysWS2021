#Measurements

We should compare the measurements of using docker to the measurements from last week.

## Task 2

Took: 259340ms using 1 VM

## Task 3

Took: 288449ms

## Observations

This week took about 30 seconds longer which is pretty much what we were expecting because of the bigger overhead.
We have to install docker, download the image and then start executing it versus just installing java and directly
execute it.
