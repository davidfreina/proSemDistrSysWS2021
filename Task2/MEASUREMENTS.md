#Measurements

We measure the time to upload, execute and download everything from the VM to our local machine

## Task 3

Full took: 259340ms

## Task 4

Half one took: 115494ms

Half two took: 170554ms

Because of parallel execution on two VM's the whole calculation took therefore: 170554ms

## Task 5

We initially splitted the numbers like this:

half_one | half_two
--- | ---|
3 | 47
44| 2
5| 45
42| 4
7 | 43
40| 6
9| 41
38|8
11|39
36|10
13| 37
34|12
15| 35
32| 14
17| 33
30| 16
19| 31
28| 18
21| 29
26| 20
23| 27
24| 22
- | 25

Which lead to the following times:

Half one took: 115494ms

Half two took: 170554ms
